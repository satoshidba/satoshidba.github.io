  Welcome to my personal website, I have been helped out on many occasions from
  the various communities out there who have done the noble thing to give
  something back...now it's my turn to try!

title: 'Welcome to Satoshi DBA '

This is the inaugural posting on Satoshi DBA, are you wondering what is to come or what to expect? If so, that makes at least two of us, dear reader!

I've learned plenty from independent websites and other contributors within various communities so perhaps it was time to take some brave pills and give back with some posts on topics that I either have an interest in or can comment with a certain level of authority. I have no background in creative writing however I am keen to develop this in order to more concisely focus my thoughts.

I am a DBA by profession and to help to develop my skills and understanding, I felt it would be good to carry out some independent learning both on my preferred technology of SQL Server but also PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB amongst others.

So that covers the DBA part of the site name, I am not Japanese so perhaps you are wondering what on earth Satoshi has to do with it?

Today is Halloween in the year 2024 which isn't remarkable in itself however released to zero fanfare on the same day in 2008, a whole 16 years ago, was the Bitcoin White Paper by a pseudonymous author known only as Satoshi Nakamoto.

Whilst I'm not striving for anonymity with this site, I don't want to have my own name as "The Brand" hence why I ended up with Satoshi DBA which brings together those personal influences.

As well as DBA & Bitcoin posts, I intend to publish content on a range of self hosted applications and tools that I use or experiment with that have some benefits to me in the real world, particularly Home Assistant.

So, dear reader, feel free to take any advice or information I share and I hope that it can prove helpful to you at some point in this universe!
